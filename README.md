# Malachite

The Goal of malachite is to become a fully customizable game development tool
that acts as a strong base for any Game related systems you may want to build ontop of.

Main Core Features I want to see Malachite have for VS

- ECS and Data Oriented Design
- Resource Mangement
- Determanstic Time System - ideally all game layers with the execption of rendering will use accurate time measurments instead of floats
- Precise / Consistent Math calculations

## NOTE malachite is far from complete and is being steered by me :D.

Malachite is meant to serve as a Engine that is highly customizable and easy to setup.
